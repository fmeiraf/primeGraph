# [1.1.0] - 2025-02-17

### Added

- Now users can pass a list of node names to the `add_repeating_edge` method to assign custom names to the repeated nodes.
- Added `is_repeat` metadata to nodes that are part of a repeating edge.
- Added `original_node` metadata to nodes that are part of a repeating edge.
- Allowed the user to retrieve Node information at execution on the node function body by using the `self.node` attribute.

# [1.0.0] - 2025-03-01

### Added

- Introduction of new asynchronous engine methods `execute()` and `resume()` which replace the old synchronous methods such as `start()` and `resume_async()`.
- New examples and documentation updates demonstrating how to run workflows using asyncio (e.g., using `asyncio.run(...)`).
- Enhanced checkpoint persistence with improved saving and loading of engine state.

### Changed

- Refactored engine internals for better handling of parallel execution, flow control, and convergence points.
- Updated ChainStatus to be a string (for enhanced debugging clarity).
- Updated state management and buffer validation error messages.

### Fixed

- Addressed issues with buffer type validation and provided clearer error messages.
- Fixed several issues in the engine related to node routing and cyclical workflows.
